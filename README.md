## Introduction to Quantum Computing
We began with some general ideas and impact of Quantum Computing. Then some basic elements of QC like the qubit and related ideas like dirac notation, bloch spheres and superposition were introduced. First we dealt with single qubit and then multiqubit systems where we looked at entanglement, the bell state of a qubit pair serving as an example. We also noticed how the dimension of state space grows exponentially with number of qubits. Then we looked at the fundamental element of quantum circuits-quantum gates. We learnt how both single and multiple qubit gates are unitary operators and looked at some important gates like X, Y, Z, H, CNOT and others. Then we looked at measurements-another element of quantum circuits. 
## Introductory Quantum Mechanics 
We built upon the fundamental mathematical concepts and theorems from linear algebra on vector spaces, bases, linear operators, inner products which can define an inner product space, eigenvectors and eigenvalues, adjoints, hermetian and unitary operators alongwith theorems on normal operators, tensor products-which are used to define multiqubit states in terms of single qubit states, polar and singular value decomposition.

Then we moved on to postulates of Quantum Mechanics where we looked at the state space-the vector space of quantum states, time evolution of quantum states which involves a unitary operator- the propagator, and the Schrodinger equation, and also postulates on measurements in Quantum Mechanics. Under Quantum measurements, we looked at measurement operators, their completeness relation and the probabilities associated with measurement. Next we looked at the problem of distinguishing quantum states and learnt that we cannot reliably distinguish non-orthogonal states. Then we dived deeper into measurements and looked at the particular subset of projective measurements, which are the typical measurements that are learnt in physics, as well as POVM measurements.
